# Healthcare Analytics Project: Wait Times Analysis Before and After COVID-19 üè•üìä
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Healthcare Analytics Project! This project focuses on exploring wait times for priority procedures across Canada, both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, using Tableau for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes in wait times for various priority procedures in Canada. We analyze a diverse range of data sources to identify trends, correlations, and insights related to wait times. Specifically, we focus on the impact of the pandemic on wait times for procedures such as cancer screenings, cardiac care, knee replacements, and more. Additionally, we examine provincial and territorial initiatives aimed at managing wait times and assess the effects of these interventions.

## Dataset and Project Details

The primary technology utilized in this project is Tableau, a powerful tool for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.

## Final Outcome and Deliverables
The project culminates in three interactive Tableau dashboards, each providing valuable insights for hospitals across Canadian provinces to learn from and improve their wait times post-COVID.
* Dataset Analysis Dashboard: This dashboard offers an overview of the dataset used in the project, providing insights into the data sources and variables.
* Pre-COVID Wait Time Analysis Dashboard: Explore the wait times for priority procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. Identify patterns, trends, and comparisons between different provinces.
* Post-COVID Wait Time Analysis Dashboard: Dive into the impact of the pandemic on wait times for priority procedures. Uncover changes, variations, and insights for effective wait time management.
