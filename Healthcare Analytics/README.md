# **Description**

**This Healthcare Analytics Project uses Tableau to explore wait times for priority procedures across Canada before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.** 

The project uses a variety of data sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the changes in wait times, as well as to identify trends, correlations, and other insights. Specifically, the project will examine the effects of the pandemic on wait times for procedures such as cancer screenings, cardiac care, knee replacements, and much more. It will also look at the impact of provincial and territorial initiatives to manage wait times, such as the introduction of additional healthcare resources or changes to existing protocols. Finally, the project will analyze the effects of the pandemic on wait times in different provinces throughout Canada. Through this analysis, the project will provide valuable insights into the changes in wait times that have occurred due to the pandemic, and help healthcare providers better understand how to effectively manage wait times in the future and learn from other provinces as well.
