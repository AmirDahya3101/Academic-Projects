## Project Scope
This project aims to revolutionize the online food ordering process for customers, offering a more efficient and convenient way to purchase food from restaurants. The main objective is to enhance the ordering process for both customers and restaurants by minimizing manual data entry.

## Project Objectives:
* Development of an Online Food Ordering Application: Create a user-friendly application that allows customers to easily browse and filter food options based on various criteria such as cuisine type, distance, price, and food categories. The application will provide a seamless and intuitive interface for customers to explore restaurant menus and make informed choices.
* Order Placement and Online Payments: Enable customers to add desired food items to their cart, customize their orders, and complete the payment process online. Implement secure payment gateways to ensure smooth and secure transactions.
* Customer Details and Post-Delivery Reviews: Incorporate a feature where customers can provide their contact details, delivery address, and any specific instructions for their orders. Additionally, allow customers to submit reviews and ratings after the delivery of their orders, contributing to the feedback ecosystem.
* Real-time Order Tracking and Updates: Implement a robust tracking system that keeps customers informed about the progress of their orders. This feature will provide regular updates on the status of order preparation, dispatch, estimated delivery time, and any changes or delays that may occur.
* Invoicing and Digital Receipts: Generate digital receipts for customers, including comprehensive order details, payment information, and applicable taxes. These receipts will be sent to customers via email or SMS for their convenience and record-keeping.
* Restaurant Backend Management: Develop a user-friendly backend system that empowers restaurant owners to manage their menus directly from the application. This functionality will allow them to update food items, add or remove specials, and adjust prices, ensuring menu accuracy and flexibility.
