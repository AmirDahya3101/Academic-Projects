## HISTORY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS & CURRENT OPERATIONS
American Express was founded in 1850 as a freight forwarding and mail service company. It expanded into the financial services industry by offering a money order component just a few years later. American Express launched its first charge cards in the 1950s and has since gone on to become one of the best-known credit card companies around the world.

After the U.S. federal government nationalized the express industry in 1918, thereby consolidating all domestic express operations in the American Railway Express Company, American Express turned almost wholly to its banking operations and its relatively new travel services, which had been launched in 1915. Today, American Express is the largest global payments network and continues to pride itself on being forward-looking and customer-focused.

As for its current operations, American Express offers a wide range of products and services including credit cards, charge cards, travel services, merchant services, and more. The company has also been expanding its digital capabilities in recent years with new mobile apps and online tools.


## AMERICAN EXPRESS CURRENT INITIATIVES
American Express has been focusing on several initiatives recently. One of its most recent initiatives is its Advancing Climate Solutions program, which aims to pilot low-carbon product innovations for its customers. As part of this program, American Express has announced plans to introduce new digital solutions to enable corporate clients to better understand and manage their carbon footprint, including digital carbon tracking and offset solutions, and the expansion of its recycled plastic cards.

In addition to its climate initiatives, American Express has also been working on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) within the company. After spending more than $1 billion toward its Action Plan to advance DE&I, American Express announced a new goal to spend an additional $3 billion with suppliers from underrepresented groups and toward other DE&I initiatives.


## MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS CYCLE
As a financial services company, American Express is heavily influenced by the macroeconomic environment, business cycle, and industry trends in the payments sector.

The macroeconomic environment has a significant impact on American Express. The company is affected by interest rates, inflation, and overall economic growth. During periods of economic expansion, American Express has historically experienced higher consumer spending and demand for credit products. On the other hand, during economic downturns or changes in interest rates, American Express may experience reduced consumer spending, which could negatively impact its revenue and profitability.

Currently, the US economy is in a state of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy has shown significant improvement since the pandemic’s onset, and the labor market has shown consistent gains. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in November 20213, down from its peak of 14.8% in April 20202. The Federal Reserve has also kept interest rates near zero since the pandemic’s onset to support economic growth. These factors have contributed to increased consumer spending and demand for credit products, which bodes well for American Express.


## INDUSTRY COMPETITORS
As a major player in the payments industry, American Express faces competition other credit card companies such as Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), as well as from banks and other financial institutions such as HDFC Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Prologis, The Goldman Sachs Group, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Wells Fargo & Company, Charles Schwab, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley.

•	American Express has a market share of approximately 19.6%
•	Visa is the main competitor to American Express with a market share of approximately 53%.
•	Mastercard has a market share of approximately 22%.
•	Discover Financial Services has a market share of approximately 3.6%.
•	JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a market share of approximately 2.6%.
•	Capital One Financial Corp. has a market share of approximately 2.4%.
•	PayPal Holdings, Inc. has a market share of approximately 1.4%.

American Express differentiates itself from its competitors by targeting high-end customers and offering unique benefits and rewards programs. Because American Express is in the closed-loop network, being the issuer and acquirer, they attract more of an affluent customer base who are more likely to spend more on their transactions. Despite this disparity, American Express has annual gross revenues of $33 billion while Visa earns just $14 billion per year.
