American Express, founded in 1850, has evolved from a freight forwarding and mail service company to become one of the world's leading credit card companies. With a rich history in financial services, American Express offers a wide range of products and services, including credit cards, charge cards, travel services, and merchant services.

American Express is also committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within its organization, with a dedicated action plan and a goal to spend an additional $3 billion with suppliers from underrepresented groups.

## MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS CYCLE 🌐📉📈
As a financial services company, American Express is significantly influenced by the macroeconomic environment and the business cycle. Factors such as interest rates, inflation, and overall economic growth impact the company's performance. During economic expansions, American Express typically experiences increased consumer spending and demand for credit products. Conversely, economic downturns or changes in interest rates can result in reduced consumer spending, potentially affecting the company's revenue and profitability.

Currently, the US economy is in a recovery phase from the COVID-19 pandemic, showing promising signs of improvement. With the labor market gaining momentum and interest rates kept low by the Federal Reserve, consumer spending and demand for credit products are on the rise. This positive macroeconomic environment bodes well for American Express.

## INDUSTRY COMPETITORS 🏦💳
American Express faces competition from other credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard, as well as banks and financial institutions. While American Express holds a market share of approximately 19.6%, Visa dominates the market with around 53% share, and Mastercard follows with approximately 22%. Other notable competitors include Discover Financial Services, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Capital One Financial Corp., and PayPal Holdings, Inc.

American Express differentiates itself by targeting high-end customers and offering unique benefits and rewards programs. Being in the closed-loop network allows American Express to attract affluent customers who are more likely to spend more on transactions. Despite differences in market share, American Express generates higher annual gross revenues compared to Visa.
